# busybus

This code is for the public transportation app Busybus. Due to expansion, the local transit authority in Philadelphia added several bus lines to each bus stop. Riders have been complaining about one bus stop in particular that serves seven bus lines. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. The BusyBus mobile app aims to solve this problem by providing important bus information to help riders plan their trip accordingly.
